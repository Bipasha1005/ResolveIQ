# ResolveIQ
# 🤖 AI-Driven Multi-Agent Customer Support System

Boost your customer service efficiency with an AI-powered multi-agent framework that automates query summarization, action extraction, department routing, solution recommendation, and resolution time prediction.

## 🚀 Overview

This project is built for the Accenture Online Hackathon and focuses on solving real-world challenges in customer support operations. By leveraging NLP and machine learning, it simulates an intelligent support agent that streamlines query handling and improves resolution efficiency.

## 📌 How It Works

1. **Input**: Raw user query (e.g., "@AppleSupport my iPhone won't charge 🔋")
2. **Summarization**: A distilled version of the query is generated.
3. **Action Classification**: The type of request is predicted.
4. **Routing**: The query is mapped to the right team (e.g., Tech Support).
5. **Solution Recommendation**: A solution is fetched based on training data.
6. **Resolution Time Prediction**: Estimated time is shown for resolution.
